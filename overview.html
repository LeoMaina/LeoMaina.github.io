    Hello, My name is Leonard Maina and this is my official web portfolio.<br>
    I am a fully qualified professional engineer having recently graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Mechatronics Engineering, with Second class Upper division honours from JKUAT university. I am an enthusiastic, self-motivated, reliable, responsible and hard working person. I am a mature team worker and adaptable to all challenging situations. I am able to work well both in a team environment as well as using own initiative. I am able to work well under pressure and adhere to strict deadlines.<br>
    In this portfolio, I have documented some of the projects that I have been involved in previously as a way to showcase some of the skills that I have been building on over the years. Some of these skills include but not limited to:<br>

    <h3>My Skills</h3>
    <p class="w3-text-black"> Machine Learning
    <div class="container">
  <div class="skills ml">60%</div>
  </div></p>
     Most of the machine learning projects I have done involved the use of Tensorflow Object detection API where I used transfer learning to build models and train them on the unique datasets for each project. For instance, the Wheel Clamping Robot[Patented and documented on the projects tab] utilised a raspberry pi camera as input to a model that could detect cars and the position of the wheels in real time. I have also done a freelance project on Audio classification using python where the model built was trained to identify a specific beep sound in any audio file and only actuate commands when this beep sound is detected. For this I had to use libraries such as librosa. <br>

<p class="w3-text-black"> Internet of Things
    <div class="container">
  <div class="skills IoT">80%</div>
  </div></p>
    I believe that this has been primarily my area of focus in the field of engineering. I am comfortable working with most microcontrollers such as arduino boards & esp boards, microprocessors such as the Raspberry Pi and a whole assortment of sensors, actuators and other accompanying electronic boards. On this portfolio, I have documented some of the proof of concept projects that I did during my attachment period at Gearbox Kenya either as part of team or as an individual.<br>

<p class="w3-text-black"> 3D Design and Modelling
    <div class="container">
  <div class="skills Design">80%</div>
  </div></p>
    As a Mechatronics Engineer, I have extensive experience working with design softwares such as Inventor Professional, AutoCAD, Solidworks and Fusion. I have also worked with proprietary softwares such as Prusa and Cura to 3D print some of the designs that I have built in previous projects. <br>

    <p class="w3-text-black"> Data Analytics
    <div class="container">
  <div class="skills Data_analytics">45%</div>
  </div></p>
    Aside from engineering in the conventional view, I have also indulged into data analytics as an extra skill to my skillset. I have intermediate understanding working with Power BI tools, SQL databases, Tableau, R and Python Programming as tools in giving useful insights to large volumes of data. This is a sub-skillset that I am still working on and hope to perfect in the coming years.<br>

    <p class="w3-text-black"> Robotics and AI
    <div class="container">
  <div class="skills robotics">75%</div>
  </div></p>
    This has always been a passion of mine. I believe I was brought into this world to build things and hence my passion for building robots. So far I have built a wheel clamping robot prototype, a line following robot and a maze solving robot. I am also participating in the RoboKen competition 2023 where our team has been tasked to build a pick and place robot that can assemble different parts of a wooden toy car autonomously. I am yet to document some of these projects on my portfolio.<br>

    <p class="w3-text-black"> Programming Languages
    <div class="container">
  <div class="skills Programming">60%</div>
  </div></p>
    I am fluent in C# programming language, an intermediate at C++ and Python programming language. I am also good with bash commands and capable of working with Windows, Linux and Debian operating systems. I am also currently involved in the ALX - Software Engineering 12-month program that is supposed to cover C, Python, Java and HTML programming.
